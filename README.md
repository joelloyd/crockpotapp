# CrockPot Repo

CrockPot is a recipe generation app for AndroidOS that allows a user to enter ingredients that they have in their fridge/cupboard, and then churns out appropriate recipes.

App Features:
  - Recipe generation
  - Recipe saving
  - Web-based user guide
  - Preference configuration

Written primarily in Java, with some XML, HTML and CSS.

Supports Android versions Marshmallow (6.0) and up.

Dependencies include:
  - Spoonacular API access via RapidAPI
  - OkHttp 3.12.0
  - Picasso

The source code featured in this repo does not include an API key for obvious reasons, so the app will not function properly without modification.
