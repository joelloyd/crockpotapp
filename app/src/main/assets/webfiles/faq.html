<h4 class="question">Q: Does CrockPot need an Internet connection?</h4>
<h4 class="answer">A: Yes, otherwise it cannot search the Internet for recipes.</h4>
<br>

<h4 class="question">Q: How do I navigate through the app?</h4>
<h4 class="answer">A: Click the three line icon on the menu bar at the top (or swipe from the left of the screen to the right) to open the navigation drawer,
    then click on your desired destination.</h4>
<br>

<h4 class="question">Q: How do I see all of the ingredients I put in and all of the recipes that I recieved?</h4>
<h4 class="answer">A: Both of the ingredient and recipe lists are scrollable so you can view all of the items in the list with ease.</h4>
<br>

<h4 class="question">Q: Can I enter any ingredient that I want, even if it can't be auto-completed?</h4>
<h4 class="answer">A: Yes, but please try to spell the ingredient correctly. More obscure ingredients may not yield as many recipes.</h4>
<br>

<h4 class="question">Q: Do I need to spell ingredient names correctly?</h4>
<h4 class="answer">A: Ideally, yes - the API may be able to handle slight errors but accurate spelling will provide accurate recipes.</h4>
<br>

<h4 class="question">Q: I don't like the recipe results that I am getting?</h4>
<h4 class="answer">A: Check ingredient spelling and configure your settings to recieve the recipes most applicable to you.</h4>
<br>

<h4 class="question">Q: Why did the recipe I clicked on not take me to a proper website?</h4>
<h4 class="answer">A: Unfortunately, a minority of recipes may not have fully-functioning links and this is not something in my control. Please try a different recipe in this scenario.</h4>
