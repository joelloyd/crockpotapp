<h4>Opening the settings page:</h4>
<p>To open the settings page, either click on the three-dot icon on the right of the app bar and click "Settings" or open the navigation drawer and select "Settings".</p>
<br>

<h4>Using the settings page:</h4>
<p>To use the settings page, toggle your desired setting on or off. To save your settings, click "Save Settings".</p>
<br>

<h4>What does "Ignore Pantry Ingredients" mean?</h4>
<p>Pantry ingredients include common ingredients such as sugar, flour and water - so turning this setting on means that the app will assume you have these ingredients.</p>
<br>

<h4>What does "Minimise Missing Ingredients" mean?</h4>
<p>Turning this setting on will optimise your recipe search so that recipes will include as few missing ingredients as possible.</p>
<p>Turning this setting off will optimise your recipe search so that recipes will include as many of the ingredients that you have entered as possible.</p>
